<h2 id="initial-setup-for-windows-users-only">Initial setup (for Windows users only):</h2>
<p>Open your Terminal and type the following command:</p>
<pre><code>echo &quot;export TERM=msys&quot; &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc</code></pre>
<p>then restart your machine.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-shell-and-how-do-i-access-it">What is the shell and how do I access it?</h2>
<p>The <em>shell</em> is a program that presents a command line interface which allows you to control your computer using commands entered with a keyboard instead of controlling graphical user interfaces (GUIs) with a mouse/keyboard combination.</p>
<p>A <em>terminal</em> is a program you run that gives you access to the shell. There are many different terminal programs that vary across operating systems.</p>
<p>Some important reasons to learn about the shell:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>It is very common to encounter the shell and command-line-interfaces in scientific computing, so you will probably have to learn it eventually;</p></li>
<li><p>The shell is a really powerful way of interacting with your computer. GUIs and the shell are complementary - by knowing both you will greatly expand the range of tasks you can accomplish with your computer. You will also be able to perform many tasks more efficiently;</p></li>
<li><p>More reasons: access remote servers, repeatability, documentation.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The shell is just a program and there are many different shell programs that have been developed. The most common shell (and the one we will use) is called the Bourne-Again SHell (bash). Even if bash is not the default shell, it is usually installed on most systems and can be started by typing <code>bash</code> in the terminal. Many commands, especially a lot of the basic ones, work across the various shells but many things are different. I recommend sticking with bash and learning it well.
