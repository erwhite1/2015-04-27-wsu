<h4>Objectives</h4>
<ul>
<li>Explain what conflicts are and when they can occur.</li>
<li>Resolve conflicts resulting from a merge.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>As soon as people can work in parallel, someone's going to step on someone else's toes. This will even happen with a single person: if we are working on a piece of software on both our laptop and a server in the lab, we could make different changes to each copy. Version control helps us manage these <a href="../../gloss.html#conflict">conflicts</a> by giving us tools to <a href="../../gloss.html#resolve">resolve</a> overlapping changes.</p>
<p>To see how we can resolve conflicts, we must first create one. The file <code>mars.txt</code> currently looks like this in both partners' copies of our <code>planets</code> repository:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat mars.txt</code></pre>
<p>{:class=&quot;in&quot;} <sub>~</sub> Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity <sub>~</sub> {:class=&quot;out&quot;}</p>
<p>Let's add a line to <strong>one partner's copy</strong> only:</p>
<pre><code>$ nano mars.txt
$ cat mars.txt</code></pre>
<p>{:class=&quot;in&quot;} <sub>~</sub> Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity This line added to Sarah's copy <sub>~</sub> {:class=&quot;out&quot;}</p>
<p>and then push the change to GitHub:</p>
<pre><code>$ git add mars.txt
$ git commit -m &quot;Adding a line in our home copy&quot;</code></pre>
<p>{:class=&quot;in&quot;} <sub>~</sub> [master 5ae9631] Adding a line in our home copy 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+) <sub><sub><sub> {:class=&quot;out&quot;} </sub></sub></sub> $ git push origin master <sub><sub><sub> {:class=&quot;in&quot;} </sub></sub></sub> Counting objects: 5, done. Delta compression using up to 4 threads. Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done. Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 352 bytes, done. Total 3 (delta 1), reused 0 (delta 0) To https://github.com/vlad/planets 29aba7c..dabb4c8 master -&gt; master <sub>~</sub> {:class=&quot;out&quot;}</p>
<p>Now let's have the other partner make a different change to their copy <em>without</em> updating from GitHub:</p>
<pre><code>$ cd /tmp/planets
$ nano mars.txt
$ cat mars.txt</code></pre>
<p>{:class=&quot;in&quot;} <sub>~</sub> Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity We added a different line in the other copy <sub>~</sub> {:class=&quot;out&quot;}</p>
<p>We can commit the change locally:</p>
<pre><code>$ git add mars.txt
$ git commit -m &quot;Adding a line in my copy&quot;</code></pre>
<p>{:class=&quot;in&quot;} <sub>~</sub> [master 07ebc69] Adding a line in my copy 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+) <sub>~</sub> {:class=&quot;out&quot;}</p>
<p>but Git won't let us push it to GitHub:</p>
<pre><code>$ git push origin master</code></pre>
<p>{:class=&quot;in&quot;} <sub>~</sub> To https://github.com/vlad/planets.git ! [rejected] master -&gt; master (non-fast-forward) error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/vlad/planets.git' hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind hint: its remote counterpart. Merge the remote changes (e.g. 'git pull') hint: before pushing again. hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details. <sub>~</sub> {:class=&quot;out&quot;}</p>
<p><img src="img/conflict.svg" alt="The conflicting changes" /></p>
<p>Git detects that the changes made in one copy overlap with those made in the other and stops us from trampling on our previous work. What we have to do is pull the changes from GitHub, <a href="../../gloss.html#merge">merge</a> them into the copy we're currently working in, and then push that. Let's start by pulling:</p>
<pre><code>$ git pull origin master</code></pre>
<p>{:class=&quot;in&quot;} <sub>~</sub> remote: Counting objects: 5, done.<br />remote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.<br />remote: Total 3 (delta 1), reused 3 (delta 1)<br />Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done. From https://github.com/vlad/planets * branch master -&gt; FETCH_HEAD Auto-merging mars.txt CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in mars.txt Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result. <sub>~</sub> {:class=&quot;out&quot;}</p>
<p><code>git pull</code> tells us there's a conflict, and marks that conflict in the affected file:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat mars.txt</code></pre>
<p>{:class=&quot;in&quot;} <sub>~</sub> Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD We added a different line in the other copy ======= This line added to Sarah's copy &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; dabb4c8c450e8475aee9b14b4383acc99f42af1d <sub>~</sub> {:class=&quot;out&quot;}</p>
<p>Our change---the one in <code>HEAD</code>---is preceded by <code>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</code>. Git has then inserted <code>=======</code> as a separator between the conflicting changes and marked the end of the content downloaded from GitHub with <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>. (The string of letters and digits after that marker identifies the revision we've just downloaded.)</p>
<p>It is now up to us to edit this file to remove these markers and reconcile the changes. We can do anything we want: keep the change made in the local repository, keep the change made in the remote repository, write something new to replace both, or get rid of the change entirely. Let's replace both so that the file looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat mars.txt</code></pre>
<p>{:class=&quot;in&quot;} <sub>~</sub> Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity We removed the conflict on this line <sub>~</sub> {:class=&quot;out&quot;}</p>
<p>To finish merging, we add <code>mars.txt</code> to the changes being made by the merge and then commit:</p>
<pre><code>$ git add mars.txt
$ git status</code></pre>
<p>{:class=&quot;in&quot;} <sub>~</sub> # On branch master # All conflicts fixed but you are still merging. # (use &quot;git commit&quot; to conclude merge) # # Changes to be committed: # # modified: mars.txt # <sub><sub><sub> {:class=&quot;out&quot;} </sub></sub></sub> $ git commit -m &quot;Merging changes from GitHub&quot; <sub><sub><sub> {:class=&quot;in&quot;} </sub></sub></sub> [master 2abf2b1] Merging changes from GitHub <sub>~</sub> {:class=&quot;out&quot;}</p>
<p>Now we can push our changes to GitHub:</p>
<pre><code>$ git push origin master</code></pre>
<p>{:class=&quot;in&quot;} <sub>~</sub> Counting objects: 10, done. Delta compression using up to 4 threads. Compressing objects: 100% (6/6), done. Writing objects: 100% (6/6), 697 bytes, done. Total 6 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0) To https://github.com/vlad/planets.git dabb4c8..2abf2b1 master -&gt; master <sub>~</sub> {:class=&quot;out&quot;}</p>
<p>Git keeps track of what we've merged with what, so we don't have to fix things by hand again when the collaborator who made the first change pulls again:</p>
<pre><code>$ git pull origin master</code></pre>
<p>{:class=&quot;in&quot;} <sub>~</sub> remote: Counting objects: 10, done.<br />remote: Compressing objects: 100% (4/4), done.<br />remote: Total 6 (delta 2), reused 6 (delta 2)<br />Unpacking objects: 100% (6/6), done. From https://github.com/vlad/planets * branch master -&gt; FETCH_HEAD Updating dabb4c8..2abf2b1 Fast-forward mars.txt | 2 +- 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-) <sub>~</sub> {:class=&quot;out&quot;}</p>
<p>we get the merged file:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat mars.txt </code></pre>
<p>{:class=&quot;in&quot;} <sub>~</sub> Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity We removed the conflict on this line <sub>~</sub> {:class=&quot;out&quot;}</p>
<p>We don't need to merge again because Git knows someone has already done that.</p>
<p>Version control's ability to merge conflicting changes is another reason users tend to divide their programs and papers into multiple files instead of storing everything in one large file. There's another benefit too: whenever there are repeated conflicts in a particular file, the version control system is essentially trying to tell its users that they ought to clarify who's responsible for what, or find a way to divide the work up differently.</p>
<div class="keypoints" markdown="1">
<h4>Key Points</h4>
<ul>
<li>Conflicts occur when two or more people change the same file(s) at the same time.</li>
<li>The version control system does not allow people to blindly overwrite each other's changes. Instead, it highlights conflicts so that they can be resolved.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="challenge" markdown="1">
Repeat the above exercise with the roles swapped, adding an additional line to the file mars.txt so the other partner deals with the merge conflict.

What does Git do when there is a conflict in an image or some other non-textual file that is stored in version control?
